    description: "Happy Sunday gentlemen of this section.I see almost everyday how men go about asking ladies for a date, burning date and airtime, trying to impress ladies which I find so disgusting.I don't know if it is a problem with me, but, I find it absurd, time and resource wasting to go days asking a lady out, buy things to impress her, call her every morning and send gifts just to have a woman around me.I have had some few girlfriend in the past and even my last ex, I only asked her out once and wait for her to make up her mind, never spent a dime on dates or gifts.Guys tell us about yourselves, do you go about doing all those zee world and nollywood styles to get your woman.",

    description: "I have fallen in love with my colleague. She has been so helpful and close to me. We hangout a lot and she creates time for me. She dots me. She is always in a hurry to help and support. If i have a complaint she scampers to look for solution. She buys me lunch and surprises me with snacks and gifts.I a have a place to go and I impromptu tell her. She volunteers to drive me there. She has a car and I don't. E speak at length every day. Morning and night.In all this, I reciprocate the gestures. I show her love and respect.After about a year. I came to the conclusion that I want to date her against my principle of dating colleagues. We once lodged in a hotel where i made my intentions clear. She said she was in a relationship. A distant one but the guy is ready to marry her. He has met her parents.I know women love to keep their options open to avoid disappointment but i felt betrayed because how is she making out time for me.I have re-emphasized my interest on two more occasions. She is thinking about it. I feel she wants to go ahead with the marriage plans.So i have moved on. Cut off consistent communications with her. I rarely respond to her message especially if they are not work related. I have subtly told her that we cannot be having a subtle affair.She doesn't seem to keep off. She has maintained her fake interest in me.What do i do?",
